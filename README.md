# eVTOL-Concept-Lab
Set of Conceptual Design Tools for eVTOLs and eCTOL aircrafts

## What is this about?
The eVTOL industry is poised for rapid growth, but the conceptual design phase remains a bottleneck, especially for early start-ups. Current tools are often fragmented, expensive, or tailored towards traditional aircraft design. This open-source toolset aims to democratize the eVTOL design process by providing accessible, integrated, and specialized tools for early-stage concept exploration. By streamlining the workflow and enabling rapid iteration, the aim is to empower engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts to unleash their creativity and accelerate the development of innovative eVTOL designs.

## Timeline?
A crude version already exists in a (now privated) repo. This repo will house the refined version of the tools and integreate the codebase to develop a GUI enabled software.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated. Whether you're fixing a bug, implementing a new feature, or improving documentation, your efforts contribute to making this project better for everyone. Just fork it, implement your code and contact me throught pull request or my linkedIn (find it in my github profile).
